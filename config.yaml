    image: "/images/formatura.png"
    content: |-
      Graduated in Software Engineering from the University of BrasÃ­lia, with a focus on Competitive Programming and **Game Development**. I've participated in several Programming Marathons, many Game Jams, and even tried building an MMO with some friends (yeah, a bit of a crazy ideaâ€¦ we definitely bit off more than we could chew, but who knows, maybe one day it'll happen?). Currently, I work at **External Secrets Inc.** as a Full Stack Engineer, developing solutions for **secrets management**. I also worked at ANTAQ, where I developed internal systems.

      Ever since I can remember, I've been passionate about gamesâ€”whether on PC, console, or mobileâ€”and I've always admired the influence they have on players and the emotions they spark. My goal is to one day **create games that bring this same passion to others**, games that captivate players just as much as I was when I played The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time for the first time.
