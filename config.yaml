    content: |-
      Graduating in Software Engineering at the University of Brasília, focusing on **Competitive Programming** and **Game Development**. I participated in several Programming Marathons, some Game Jams and I tried to create an MMO with some friends (crazy, I know... We try to take a bigger step than our leg, but who knows, maybe one day it won't work?!). I was the manager of the Hallelujah project, at **Orc'estra Gamificação**, in addition to having been responsible for creating various content posted on the company's blog.
      
      For as long as I can remember I've been passionate about games, whether it's computer, console or mobile, and I've always admired the influence they have on their players, the feelings they arouse. My goal is to one day be able to **create games that bring that same passion I have to those who play them**, that leave them as mesmerized as I was when I played "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time" for the first time.

          Initially I worked in the creation of arts and posts for facebook and instagram, but, after defining the areas of operation, I was responsible for creating and disseminating the contents of the [company's blog](https://orcestra.com.br/blogs/), which achieved a growth of 300% during my services.
          
          During this period I studied several contents such as SEO and copywriting, to improve the level and reach of publications; Self-Determination Theory and other psychology content, in order to be able to write about motivation; Octalysis and other gamification frameworks, for texts on this subject; and software content, such as Requirements Elicitation or Scrum.
